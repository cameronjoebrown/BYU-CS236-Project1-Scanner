# BYU-CS236-Project1-Scanner

A project for CS 236 (Discrete Structures) at BYU during Winter Semester 2019. In this project, I made a scanner/lexer for
the Datalog program. The program took a file with Datalog code as input, scanned each item and assigned them a token name, and
output each of these tokens with the token, the name of the token, and the line number it was found on. If an unknown token
was found, it was assigned a token name of UNDEFINED.

This project had to be passed off in person by the TAs for the course by running different test cases on our program. Unlike
my previous CS classes, we weren't given the test cases the TAs would use beforehand so I had to make my own test cases to 
prepare to pass it off.
